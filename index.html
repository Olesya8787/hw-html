                     A real woman should always radiate special fluids of sensuality and guard a little mystery, be able to intrigue. So that you always feel like the most attractive representative of the fair sex, the Estee Lauder Sensuous fragrance will give you a special oriental woody fragrance. Just a few drops of perfume can make your head spin and give you a sense of calm.

The initial notes of the fragrance, in which sweet lily, rich magnolia and slightly intoxicating jasmine are manifested, symbolize true femininity and sensuality. Wood and ambergris in "heart" overflows seem to hint at a slight moodiness. Fragrant sandalwood, spicy black pepper, juicy tangerine and warm honey leave a lasting trail in memory, which hides the passion and unbridledness of a real woman - the owner of this fragrance.
